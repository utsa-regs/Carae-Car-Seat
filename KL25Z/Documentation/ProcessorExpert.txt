Module "CE"        (component BitIO)
   - CE_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - CE_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - CE_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - CE_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "CSN"       (component BitIO)
   - CSN_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - CSN_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - CSN_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - CSN_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "IRQ"       (component ExtInt)
   - IRQ_GetVal -Returns the actual value of the input pin of the component.

Module "SM1"       (component SynchroMaster)
   - SM1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data).   For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.
   - SM1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel.
   - SM1_RecvBlock -If any data received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns error code (it does not wait for data).  If less than requested number of characters is 
                received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified destination and the 
                ERR_EXEMPTY value is returned.  This method is available only if non-zero length of input buffer is defined.    
                For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.
   - SM1_SendBlock -Send a block of characters to the channel. This method is only available if a non-zero length of output 
                buffer is defined.
   - SM1_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer. This method is available only if a non-zero length of input buffer is defined.
   - SM1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer. This method is only available if a non-zero length of output buffer is defined.
   - SM1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer.  Note: If the Interrupt service is disabled, 
                and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method returns 1 
                although it was an empty character.
   - SM1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer.
   - SM1_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned in given methods). The component 
                accumulates errors in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared. This method is 
                available only if the "Interrupt service/event" property is enabled.

Module "LEDR"      (component LED)
   - LEDR_On -This turns the LED on.

                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDR_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDR_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

   - LEDG_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDG_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins,
